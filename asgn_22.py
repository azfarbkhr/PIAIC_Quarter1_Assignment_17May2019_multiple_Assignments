Requirements
22.	Write a Python program to calculate body mass index. (https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/articles/health/bmi-formula-for-bmi-calculations.php)

BMI = weight (kg) รท height2 (m2)

BMI	                BMI Category
Less than 15	    Very severely underweight
Between 15 and 16	Severely underweight
Between 16 and 18.5	Underweight
Between 18.5 and 25	Normal (healthy weight)
Between 25 and 30	Overweight
Between 30 and 35	Moderately obese
Between 35 and 40	Severely obese
Over 40	            Very severely obese
